// A recursive function is a function that calls itself as part of its execution.
// Recursive algorithms are often used in divide-and-conquer strategies
// where a problem is divided into smaller sub-problems, solved independently, and then combined. 
// This approach can be efficient for problems like sorting and searching.y
